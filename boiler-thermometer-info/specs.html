    <span class="alpha">T</span>he Infra-View® Infrared Sensor is a two wire 4-20 mA output intelligent device powered by 24 VDC with a maximum loop impedance of 700 ohms. The Infra-View has remote online addressability and accuracy to +-1% of the reading up to 3,000°F and is factory calibrated to an NIST certified standard in accordance with MIL-STD-45662. The sensor has a 30:1 field of view (FOV) indicating that 30ft from the sight tube there is a 1ft diameter field. Multiple sensors can be combined in a network configuration and terminated into a Distributed Control System(DCS). The sensor has the following adjustments that can be performed remotely for system maintenance and customization over two wire loop using HART® industrial protocol. The HART® signals combine simultaneous digital communication over standard 4-20 mA output cable. By utilizing the Infra-View programming software and RS-232 port or USB adapter, the following maintenance and customization features can be modified while units are online.
