    Infra-View® Infrared Thermometers are remote sensing infrared detectors that are permanently flange mounted on any port, door or penetration into the boiler or furnace. The Infra-View patented design is supplied with a rugged protective cooling jacket that is factory assembled and pre-piped with an air cooler, purging and filtering system designed to work in most severe service environments. Customer supplied compressed air and two wire shielded signal cable is all that is necessary for operation when integrated in a 4-20 mA signal loop supplied from a DCS, digital or analog recording device. The Infra-View®; infrared "non-contact" sensor monitors flue gas temperatures in the boiler or furnace ranging from 250°F to 3,000°F (higher end temperature available).
