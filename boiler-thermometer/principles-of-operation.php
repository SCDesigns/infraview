        <p class="common-BodyText">
          <span class="alpha">T</span>he Infra-View® sensor detects the heated CO2 gas created in a boiler or furnace
          as a by product of the combustion process when fossil fuels such as, all grade coals, natural gas, oil, lignite, peat and refuse are burned.
          The infrared spectral response of the Infra-View sensor is preset specifically to detect the CO2 gas spectrum.
          It can measure the average or peak temperature of the gas directly within the 30:1 field of view as it is heated within the specified 250°F to 3,000°F
          temperature range (Note: higher end temperatures available).
          Since the boiler is a dynamic environment, the Infra-View® is designed to continuously measure the CO2 at a
          sampling rate of 100 msec. in the rising stream of heated flue gas at that may exceed 25 ft./ sec.
        </p>
        <p class="common-BodyText">
          Infra-View® Infrared Thermometers are in-situ remote sensing infrared detectors that are permanently flange mounted on any port,
          door or penetration into the boiler or furnace. The Infra-View patented design is supplied with a rugged protective cooling jacket
          that is factory assembled and pre-piped with an air cooler, purging and filtering system designed to work in most severe service environments.
          Customer supplied compressed air and two wire shielded signal cable is all that is necessary for operation when integrated in a 24 VDC and 4-20 mA
          signal loop supplied from a DCS, digital or analog recording device.
